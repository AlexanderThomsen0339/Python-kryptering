I wake up every morning, feeling fine,  
The sun is shining bright, it's a perfect time.  
I walk outside and breathe the air,  
Life's so sweet, I don't have a care.

The birds are singing up in the trees,  
A gentle breeze brings a sense of ease.  
I smile at strangers passing by,  
Underneath the big blue sky.

I take a step and start to run,  
Chasing dreams beneath the sun.  
With every step, I feel so free,  
The world is waiting, just for me.

I hear the music in the street,  
People laughing, feeling the beat.  
Dancing together, hand in hand,  
Spreading joy across the land.

As the day turns into night,  
Stars above are shining bright.  
I close my eyes and drift away,  
Grateful for this perfect day.

Tomorrow promise calls my name,  
A new adventure, never the same.  
With hope in my heart, I'll carry on,  
The journey just begun, it is never gone.
